<p>Deloitte Content Management
Solution for Oil & Gas Companies
Increasing efficiency and reducing risk
through better control over information
For Oil & Gas companies, maintaining
and accessing accurate and upto-date content, such as technical
documentation, is critical for ongoing
operational effectiveness and risk
mitigation. For example, engineering
and operations need quick access to the
latest documentation for plant, facilities,
and equipment so that they can do
their jobs efficiently. At the same time,
environmental and safety regulations
specify the need for processes and
systems that protect and control
this documentation.
Introducing the Deloitte Content
Management Solution for Oil & Gas
Companies
After years of working with leaders at
many of the world’s most respected and
well-known energy companies, we have
designed a solution that targets some of
the most common and difficult information
management challenges. The Deloitte
Content Management Solution for Oil & Gas
Companies brings a systematic approach
that helps streamline the management
of content, such as technical documents,
and incorporates leading practices and
governance processes to enhance efficiency
and remedy common sources of risk.
The Deloitte Content Management
Solution for Oil & Gas Companies
addresses the needs of both downstream
and upstream activities. Information
producers can create documents more
efficiently, while producing content
that is easier to consume. Information
consumers can access documents more
easily and can trust that they are getting
up-to-date information. Managers can
achieve greater operational efficiency
through streamlined processes for
content creation and management and
also have greater visibility into the
status of documentation and user
access patterns.

Capabilities and value of Deloitte Content Management Solution for Oil & Gas Companies
The solution utilizes OpenText Content Server software as a central repository for managing unstructured content. The content
repository is also integrated with business applications to make the content available within enterprise business workflows.
Predefined workflows and integrations between OpenText and the business applications help create additional value by capturing
leading practices for managing operational and engineering assets.
The following capabilities are included in Deloitte’s solution:
• Controlled Revision Tracking—Track revisions throughout the
document life cycle using OpenText Content Server as the
central repository.<br>
• CAD Manager—The structure of the complex relationships between
CAD drawings is maintained within the metadata of the OpenText
Content Server repository.<br>
• Advanced State Management—Preconfigured process flows enforce
the required level of document control at each stage in the document’s
life cycle.<br>
• Transmittal Management—Outbound transmittals are securely
packaged and controlled through an automated process that enables
standardized transmittal packages and offers consistency and
auditability for controlled information that leaves the organization.<br>
• Automatic Document Numbering—Implementation of complex
document schemas inside OpenText Content Server facilitates a
standardized document creation process with standard
document formats.<br>
• Annotations—Browser-based access to view, annotate, and
collaborate on files stored in the OpenText Content Server eliminates
the need for expensive licenses for native applications and increases
the accessibility of important technical data.<br>
These capabilities also address other common operational needs, such
as land management, joint invoice billing, and material transfers.
